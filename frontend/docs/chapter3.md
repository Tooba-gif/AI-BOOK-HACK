# Chapter 3: Sensors and Perception in Physical AI

## Types of Sensors

Physical AI systems rely on various sensors to perceive their environment:

- Visual sensors (cameras, LIDAR)
- Tactile sensors (force, pressure, temperature)
- Proprioceptive sensors (position, acceleration, orientation)

## Sensor Fusion

Modern Physical AI systems combine data from multiple sensors to form a comprehensive understanding of their environment.

## Computer Vision

Visual perception is crucial for humanoid robots to recognize objects, people, and navigate spaces.

## Interactive Elements
